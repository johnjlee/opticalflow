*** WARNING: HERE BE DRAGONS! ***

This code was written for the final project of MIT 6.866 (Machine Vision).
It is a basic implementation of optical flow and FOE detection. The code
was written in a time long before I knew how to design code well.

All .c files are libraries, which are linked into the poorly-named
test.c. This program reads a series of PGM files (representing a
video), and outputs another series of PGM files with needles rendered
on it (representing the computed optical flow). It also will draw a
white dot on the image representing the FOE.

The included video2images.sh script and jpegtoavi binaries can aid in
converting a video to a series of PGM files.
